### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned
I learnt how to import variable font files into a project for the first time
```css
@font-face {
    font-family: 'Outfit';
    src: url(font/Outfit/Outfit-VariableFont_wght.ttf) format('truetype-variations');
    font-weight: 100 900;
}
```

### Continued development

To be honest CSS is not my strong suit currently but, i can't wait to try out more CSS rules in the forthcoming Frontend Mentor projects. I took quite a while on this project (about 4 hrs) and i would love to do better next time

### Useful resources
